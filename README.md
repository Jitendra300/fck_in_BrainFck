# Fck in BrainFck
We wrote a brainfck (or friendly called as BrainFreak) program to print Fck.

# Why do it?
Cause its fun, and I had no other thing to do...so yea settled for this...

# Logic:
The logic is pretty simple. As in brainfck programs we are given a turing tape where we hold values in each cell. We keep some values which hold the ASCII value of the symbols used to display fck. At the start we initialize the tape with all the values nessecary. Then we go ahead and print it.

# Code:
There are three files namely __code_Shaped_as_fck.bf__, __unoptimized_Code_with_Comments.bf__ and __unoptimized_Code_without_Comments.bf__. Each serves its purpose as the name suggests. I also do believe that there is more room for optimization, hence have named this code as unoptimized. With different approach we can achieve even more smaller brainfck code.<br>

# Code Shaped as fuck???
Yes we have a brainfck program which is shaped as a fck and which prints fck...isn't that fun?

# Future Projects:
Make a Brainfreak compiler in Brainfreak <br><br>
Make a JIT compiler for Brainfreak
